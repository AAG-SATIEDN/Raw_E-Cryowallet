title: You can now access your CryoWallet by a web link.
updated: 20 Jun, 2013

We've now added instawallet style URL's to CryoWallet, so you can now open a wallet as easy as.

"http://CryoWallet.com/#tell-thick-yeah-friend-mock-paint-curse-emotion-silent-salty-flood-gentle":http://CryoWallet.com/#tell-thick-yeah-friend-mock-paint-curse-emotion-silent-salty-flood-gentle

Sorry, there's no money in that wallet.

The # in the URL means that the passphrase will never be sent by the browser to the server. So the URL will never be recorded. This is a good idea to use with day to day spending accounts, where quick access is more important than overall security.

This would also work with your electrum passphrase, just prepend your passphrase with

@http://CryoWallet.com/#@

And convert all the spaces to minus signs (-).

Enjoy, The CryoWallet team.
