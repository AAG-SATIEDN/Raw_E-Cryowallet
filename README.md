I'm a wallet Jim, but not as you know it.

CryoWallet is a deterministic wallet. Your passphrase is turned into a number which is turned into Bitcoin Addresses. With us your passphrase literally IS your wallet access and backup. Unlike old-style Bitcoin wallets, if you write down the seed to your CryoWallet, and your hard drive gets corrupted, you can recreate your wallet using the same passphrase and all of the addresses, keys and balance will come back again exactly as before.

I'm zero footprint cold storage

We don't store your Bitcoins or your private-keys on our servers, they exist only in memory, and no trace is left on your device once you logout of a session. This way neither ourselves or any hackers can get at your bitcoins via our servers. Traditional 'cold storage' means storing coins offline. If you lose that device your stash goes too. Now you can safely store bitcoins without fear of unscrupulous exchanges. I'm non-device specific cold storage.

Your passphrase is your wallet.

Your passphrase is turned into a 128bit key which is then stretched into 10 bitcoin addresses. According to "how big is your haystack?" Our passphrases would take trillions of centuries to break under a massive cracking scenario.

Our passphrases are also compatible with Brainwallet.org and Electrum Wallets, so even if this site goes down you'll still have access to your funds.
